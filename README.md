The BIOS is the first piece of software your PC runs when your turn it on, and you usually see it as a brief flash of white text on a black screen.  It initializes the hardware and provides an abstraction layer to the operating system, freeing them from having to understand the exact details of how to deal with devices.

The BIOS also runs a Power On Self Test, or POST, which discovers, initialized and catalogs all connected devices, and provides an interface for conjuration. It also loads the operating system into the RAM from a boot device. If you have a bad stick of memory, your computer will not boot past the POST until you remove it.

## How to upgrade Bios ?

Although the specifics will vary depending on the manufacturer for your computer or motherboard, there are three basic steps to update your BIOS:

* Check current version of your BIOS
* Check if there are any updates
* Update the BIOS

### Update the BIOS

Most BIOS files will come with Read Me files. Make sure you read those! They will list changes from the previous version (usually called a Change Log), as well as compatibility issues and instructions.

If the BIOS file is a .exe updating the BIOS is very simple: close all other programs and run the .exe. It’ll handle installing the new BIOS and restarting your computer.

Some manufacturers have a different procedure. You’ll need to load the BIOS files you downloaded to an external USB drive and plug it in. Restart your computer and enter the BIOS. When your computer restarts, there should briefly be white text on a black screen (perhaps with a logo) that tells you the key you need to press to get into the BIOS.

This will be easy to miss, but the keys are usually F1, F2, F11, Esc, or Delete. It might take a few tries to get the keys and the timing just right. Finally, you’ll need to navigate the BIOS (using the keyboard) to the Tools/Update section. For example, for ASUS motherboards you’ll find the ASUS EZ Flash Utility in the Tools tab. MSI calls it the M-FLASH option. Select the BIOS file in your USB drive and hit enter. On other BIOS implementations the process may vary, but it should be similar. Your computer will update and then restart.

Assuming you have no errors or abrupt power failures you’re done! Enjoy your new features on your updated BIOS!
